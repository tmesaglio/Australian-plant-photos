Abstract
The Basin Plan's management arrangements will be implemented at a local scale through water resource plans prepared by the Basin states for accreditation by the Commonwealth Water Minister. The Basin has been divided into 19 surface-water water resource plan areas. The boundaries of these areas are shown in the Surface Water Water Resource Plan Areas dataset.

The surface-water water resource plan areas cover the entire Basin, including those areas not previously subject to water planning arrangements. The water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin to which the Basin Plan will apply are identified in the Water Act 2007 (Cwlth). These resources do not include the Great Artesian Basin water resources.

Purpose
To identify surface water water resource plan areas for the Water Act 2007 and Basin Plan 2012.
To prepare a map for publication on MDBA's website.

Lineage
Lineage statement
The Water Act (s. 22(1) item 2) requires that boundaries of water resource plan areas must align as far as possible with existing water management boundaries. Accordingly, the Murray–Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) used existing water planning areas as a starting point in the identification of new water resource plan areas. In some cases, existing state planning boundaries have been varied to include, for example, water resources that are not currently covered by water planning areas, or as a result of consultation with Basin states. Hydrologic, geological and hydrogeological units, such as river catchments, geological formations and aquifers, were also used to identify the new boundaries. The surface-water water resource plan areas are largely based on surface-water catchment boundaries, while the groundwater areas are based chiefly on hydrogeological units. This has meant that in most cases, different boundaries have been needed for surface water and groundwater.

As the individual Basin states are responsible for developing water resource plans, each water resource plan area is wholly contained within a single Basin state. The Basin states will be required to report to MDBA on compliance with diversion limits in each water resource plan area within four months of the end of a standard water accounting period (1 July to 30 June), providing consistency across the Basin for compliance reporting, and aligning arrangements across the Basin with the National Water Accounts reporting period.

The following data has been used to create the water resource plan areas for surface water:

Queensland:
Queensland’s Water Resource Planning Area (as contained in the data files titled: QLD_WATERRESPLANBDY_100K.dbf, QLD_WATERRESPLANBDY_100K.prj, QLD_WATERRESPLANBDY_100K.sbn, QLD_WATERRESPLANBDY_100K.sbx, QLD_WATERRESPLANBDY_100K.shp, QLD_WATERRESPLANBDY_100K.shx) provided by the State of Queensland (Department of Environment and Resource Management)

New South Wales:
- Surface water planning areas (water sharing plans) (as contained in the data files titled: SurfaceWaterWSP.dbf, SurfaceWaterWSP.prj, SurfaceWaterWSP.sbn, SurfaceWaterWSP.sbx, SurfaceWaterWSP.shp, SurfaceWaterWSP.shx) provided by the State of New South Wales (Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water).
- Adjusted SDL resource unit boundaries contained in the data file titled NOW_SDL.gdb provided by the State of New South Wales (NSW Office of Water, Primary Industries) 
- Digital Cadastral Database (DCDB) provided by the State of New South Wales (NSW Spatial Services)
